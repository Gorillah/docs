### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Import Twilio Phone Numbers">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Buy a Phone Number via Twilio">
        If you don’t already have a number in Twilio, you can purchase one by
        going to your Twilio console’s “Buy a number” section:
        <img src="/images/buy-phone-number-twilio.png" />
        Once you’ve purchased a number, it will immediately be ready for import
        into Vapi.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Locate Twilio Account SID & Auth Token">
      To complete the import on Vapi’s side, we will need to grab our Twilio “Account SID” & “Auth Token”.

        You should see a section for “API keys & tokens”, the credentials we will need for the import will live here.

      <img src="/images/twilio-api-key-nav.png" />
      Once we are in our “API keys & tokens” section, we will grab the Account SID & Auth
      Token:

      <img src="/images/twilio-credentials.png" />
      We will use both of these credentials in the next step of importing via the Dashboard.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Import via Dashboard">
    Navigate to the “Phone Numbers” section & click the “Import” button.
    
    There you will input your phone number, as well as the credentials you retrieved
    in the previous step:

    Your number is now ready to be attached to an assistant for inbound or outbound phone calling.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
