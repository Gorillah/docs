## Campaign Management

In the dashboard, you can create and manage calling campaigns effortlessly. Here's what you can do:

- **Choose Assistant**: Select the virtual assistant that will handle the calls for your campaign. Customize settings such as voice, language, and model to match your brand's persona.

- **Add Leads List**: Import your leads by adding the list containing their information, including name, email, and phone number. Ensure the phone numbers are in international format (+1234567890) for successful calling.

- **Select Twilio Phone Number**: Choose the Twilio phone number that will be used to make calls for your campaign. This ensures that your calls appear professional and reliable to your leads.

- **Enter Campaign Name**: Give your campaign a unique name that reflects its purpose or target audience. For example, you could name your campaign "Spring Sales Blitz" or "Customer Outreach Initiative."

- **Set Daily Budget**: Specify a daily budget for your campaign to control spending. Once the daily budget is reached, the campaign will stop automatically, ensuring you stay within your allocated budget.

With these features, you can create targeted calling campaigns tailored to your business goals and reach out to your leads effectively.
