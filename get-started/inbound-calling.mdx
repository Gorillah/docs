# Guide to Setting Up Inbound Calls

Setting up inbound calls with Blurr is quick and straightforward. Follow these simple steps to get started:

## 1. Import Twilio Phone Number

First, ensure you have a Twilio phone number available for receiving inbound calls. If you don't already have one, you can purchase a number through your Twilio account.

## 2. Visit Phone Numbers in Dashboard

Once you have your Twilio phone number ready, navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section in the Blurr dashboard. Here, you'll see a list of all imported phone numbers.

## 3. Select Phone Number for Inbound Calls

Click on the phone number you want your assistant to answer inbound calls on. This will take you to the phone number details page.

## 4. Choose Assistant

On the phone number details page, you'll find an option to select the assistant that will handle inbound calls on this number. Ensure that you have already created the assistant you want to assign to the phone number.

That's it! Your Twilio phone number is now configured to receive inbound calls, and your chosen assistant is ready to handle them.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues during setup, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance. Happy calling!
