An outbound call is a phone call that is dialed and goes “out” from a phone number, & in our case, our AI assistant will be doing the dialing.

## Sending Your First Outbound Phone Call with Blurr

Ready to dive into the world of outbound phone calls with Blurr? Let's get started with these three simple steps:

### 1. Create an Assistant

The first step is to create an assistant and provide it with instructions on how to conduct itself during the call. Whether you want a friendly greeting, informative responses, or assistance with specific tasks, your assistant will be tailored to your needs.

### 2. Get a Phone Number

Next, you'll need a phone number to initiate the outbound call. You can seamlessly import a phone number from Twilio, a trusted provider of communication solutions. Twilio offers a wide range of phone numbers with various features and capabilities, allowing you to choose the perfect number for your inbound and outbound calls.

### 3. Call Your Number

Once you have your assistant ready and a phone number in hand, it's time to make the call. Set your assistant as the dialer, specify the destination phone number, and initiate the call. Sit back, relax, and await the connection. With any luck, someone will pick up on the other end!
