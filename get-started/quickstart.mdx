# Welcome to the Blurr Dashboard!

Congratulations on choosing Blurr for your calling automation needs! Our dashboard provides you with powerful tools to streamline your calling campaigns and enhance your customer interactions. Let's get started on maximizing your calling potential.

## Getting Started

1. **Signup to Blurr**: If you haven't already, sign up for a Blurr account [here](https://www.blurr.app/auth/signup). Once registered, you'll gain access to the full suite of calling automation features.

2. **Import Twilio Phone Number**: Connect your Twilio phone number to Blurr to start making and receiving calls seamlessly. Follow the instructions below to import your Twilio number.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-info" title="How To Import Twilio Phone Numbers">
  To import your Twilio phone numbers into Blurr, follow these steps:
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion icon="1" title="Buy a Phone Number via Twilio">
        If you don’t already have a number in Twilio, you can purchase one by
        going to your Twilio console’s “Buy a number” section:
        <img src="/images/buy-phone-number-twilio.png" />
        Once you’ve purchased a number, it will immediately be ready for import
        into Blurr.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion icon="2" title="Locate Twilio Account SID & Auth Token">
      To complete the import on Blurr’s side, we will need to grab our Twilio “Account SID” & “Auth Token”.

        You should see a section for “API keys & tokens”, the credentials we will need for the import will live here.

      Once we are in our “API keys & tokens” section, we will grab the Account SID & Auth
      Token:

      <img src="/images/twilio-credentials.png" />
      We will use both of these credentials in the next step of importing via the Dashboard.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="3" title="Import via Dashboard">
    Navigate to the “Phone Numbers” section & click the “Import” button.
    
    There you will input your phone number, as well as the credentials you retrieved
    in the previous step:

    Your number is now ready to be attached to an assistant for inbound or outbound phone calling.

3. **Create Assistant**: Customize your virtual assistant's settings to match your brand's voice and language preferences. Choose from a variety of models and personalize its prompts for a unique caller experience.

4. **Add Your Leads**: Import your leads into Blurr by providing their name, email, phone number, and assigning them to a specific list. Ensure that phone numbers are in international format (e.g., +1234567890) for successful calling.

5. **Create Campaigns**: Set up calling campaigns to automate the outreach process. Here are some key points to remember:
   - Calls are not made on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Calls are scheduled between 8 AM and 8 PM based on the caller's local time.
   - Calls are made every 2 hours, with a maximum of twice a day, until the lead answers.
   - Once a lead is contacted, their status will be changed to "contacted," and they will not be called again.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to running efficient and effective calling campaigns with Blurr. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at [support@blurr.app](mailto:support@blurr.app). Happy calling!
